# DE1-SoC Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of projects I have completed and am currently working on using the DE1-SoC development board. Each project showcases different features and capabilities of the board, providing hands-on experience with FPGA and SoC development.

## Simple Counter
### Introduction
In this project, I followed the SE1-SoC "My First FPGA" guide, which can be found [here](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/msc_experiment/My_First_Fpga.pdf).

### Project Details
Using Intel Quartus Prime, I implemented a simple counter on the DE1-SoC board. The counter increments every second and displays the count on the onboard LEDs.

### Conclusion
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of FPGA programming and the basics of digital design using Intel Quartus Prime.
